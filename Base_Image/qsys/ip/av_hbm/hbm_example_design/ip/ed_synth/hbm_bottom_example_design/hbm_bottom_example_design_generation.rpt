Info: hbm_bottom_example_design.hbm_0_example_design_0: Starting Quartus 19.4, the backpressure registers are instantiated while generating the HBM2 IP itself and you are no longer required to implement them manually. If you have used the backpressure latency feature in a previous Quartus release and are upgrading to Quartus 19.4 or later, you will need to remove the backpressure registers manually implemented or disable the option "Automatically instantiate backpressure registers within HBM2 IP", and then regenerate the HBM2 IP. Not making this change will lead to the HBM2 interface not functional. Refer to the HBM2 IP User guide for additional information.
Info: hbm_bottom_example_design.hbm_0_example_design_0: To achieve better timing closure, disable the In-System-Sources-and-Probes.
