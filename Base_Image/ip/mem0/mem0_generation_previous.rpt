Warning: mem0.emif_s10_0: Enabling "Skip address/command leveling calibration" is only recommended for diagnostic purposes. Timing analysis does not capture the effect of non-default calibration flow.
Info: mem0.emif_s10_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: mem0.emif_s10_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 1: Component and DIMM".
Info: mem0.emif_s10_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 4 I/O Bank(s) and 4 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: mem0.emif_s10_0.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock and user clock rate, in MHz: 1200.0
Info: mem0.emif_s10_0.arch: For additional documentation about the interface, consult the *_readme.txt file after generation.
